        "Question: Homes that are built to be environmentally friendly because they use energy more efficiently than other homes are called \"green\" homes. \"Green\" homes often have reflective roofs and walls made of recycled materials. The windows in these energy-saving homes are double-paned, meaning each window has two pieces of glass. Double-paned windows have a layer of air between the window panes. This layer is a barrier against extreme temperatures and saves energy. A solar panel on a \"green\" home uses\nAnswer: a renewable energy source\n\nQuestion: What is an environmental threat posed by oil and gas acquisition and transport that is not posed by the acquisition and transport of the energy resources uranium, and wood?\nAnswer: pipeline leaks\n\nQuestion: One cause of heat in a car engine is caused by friction between parts. Which of these reduces the amount of heat produced by friction?\nAnswer: oil\n\nQuestion: The continental crust floats on top of the mantle because the crust is\nAnswer: less dense than the mantle.\n\nQuestion: If the atomic mass number of an atom is 35, which statement is most accurate?\nAnswer: The number of protons does not equal the number of neutrons.\n\nQuestion: Which is the function of the gallbladder?\nAnswer:",
